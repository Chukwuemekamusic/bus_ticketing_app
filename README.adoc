= Requirement for Bus Ticketing App

== Introduction

The Bus Ticketing App is a web-based application that allows users to book and pay for bus tickets online. It provides an easy and convenient way for users to book their trips and select their preferred seats without having to physically visit a bus terminal. The app is designed to be user-friendly and offers features such as real-time bus schedules, seat selection, and online payments.

== Configuration

Before using the Bus App, ensure that the following software is installed:

PHP 7.0 or higher 

MySQL 5.4 or higher

Apache 2.4 or higher

PHPMyAdmin

=== Connection to MySQL database

You will also need to configure the connection to your MySQL database. To do this, adjust the settings in the two connection files to match the name of your database and your database password.

The connection files are:

    * connection.php: This is the main connection file used for the webapp. It uses mysqli_connect.
        ** Relative location: cmm004_bus_app/connection.php
    * connection_pdo.php: This is used only when in populating the bus_schedules table. It used PDO to connect
        ** Relative location: cmm004_bus_app/tables_creation/connection_pdo.php


== Creating the Tables

To create the required tables, create a database named BusApp in your MySQL server using phpMyAdmin. There are 6 tables used in this database:

    * bus_schedules       
    * bus_seats    
    * users
    * bookings
    * feedback
    * users_booking

Then, you can choose one of the following options:

=== Option A (preferred)

Run the create_table.php script located inside the tables_creation folder on your browser to create all the tables into your database. 

Relative Path for the create_table.php: 
    
    * cmm004_bus_app/tables_creation/create_table.php

This will automatically load the Event handler and Trigger functions in the code. 
The Trigger function automatically updates the number of seats when a seat status changes to booked.
Event handler changes the status of a bus trip when it is completed or when date is passed.

=== Option B

Use the individual table's MySQL scripts in the tables_creation folder 

== Populating the bus_schedules and bus_seat Tables

To populate the bus_schedules table and bus_seats automatically, run the populate_tables.php located inside the tables_creation folder once. 

    * Relative Path === cmm004_bus_app/tables_creation/populate_tables.php. 

== Software Requirements
